# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a mobile app game creator with experienced success launching a competitive game on the Android platform. The client wanted to develop a web-based version of its current Android app to make the game available across multiple platforms and devices.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I was able to write a  comprehensive recommendation outlining key areas for the client’s consideration including which hosting operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, security, and the benefits of leveraging serverless architecture to launch the product.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Utilizing a UML diagram was most helpful when it came to developing the code.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the recommendation and the table of server, client, and developmental tools because I am still very much unfamliar with all of the various operating platforms. I can give recommendations off what I read and learn but expereincing them for myself gives a more authentic recommendation which I lack.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By understanding the users needs first, when developing web based apps some are speed and intuitiveness. Quality characteristics (i.e. look and feel) are also important, but less so when compared to speed and usability. Overrall clients satification on using the game as well.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Comprehension, simplicity, and gradual proggression. I realized throughout the course I was adding complexity to a simple web based game and trying to nuke the demands of the user rather than accepting it for the simiplicty of whats being asked. I would use similiar technique to analyze and design software applications in the future.
